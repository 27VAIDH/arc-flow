## Codebase Patterns
- AI service is in `src/shared/aiGroupingService.ts` — exports `getAIGroupingSuggestions(tabs, openRouterApiKey)` consumed by `OrganizeTabsModal.tsx`
- Settings type is in `src/shared/types.ts` — `Settings` interface defines all extension settings
- Settings now uses `openRouterApiKey: string` (flat field) instead of old nested `aiGrouping` object
- `settingsStorage.ts` has `migrateSettings()` that converts old `aiGrouping.apiKey` → `openRouterApiKey`
- OpenRouter API uses OpenAI-compatible response format (`data.choices[0].message.content`)
- Typecheck: `npx tsc --noEmit`, Lint: `npx eslint <file>`
- SettingsPanel.tsx uses local component pattern (e.g., `TestConnectionButton`) for self-contained UI sections
- Routing engine is in `src/shared/routingEngine.ts` — exports `matchRoute(url, rules)` for URL-to-workspace matching
- `RoutingRule` type has `enabled` field — always check it when iterating rules
- `settingsStorage.ts` migration adds `enabled: true` to old rules missing the field
- Service worker `getWorkspaceForUrl` now delegates to `matchRoute` from routingEngine.ts
- `isIgnoredUrl()` helper in service worker filters chrome://, extension://, about:blank, newtab URLs
- `ServiceWorkerMessage` type union in types.ts — add new message types here for service worker → sidepanel communication
- Auto-routing sends `tab-auto-routed` message to sidepanel when a tab is moved to a different workspace
- SettingsPanel uses local DndContext inside `RoutingRulesSection` for sortable routing rules (separate from App.tsx DndContext)
- Self-contained settings components pattern: `TestConnectionButton`, `RoutingRulesSection`, `SortableRoutingRuleRow` are all local to SettingsPanel.tsx
- App.tsx has a `toast` state with auto-dismiss (3s) — use `setToast("message")` for ephemeral notifications
- Toast renders as fixed bottom-center overlay with `animate-fade-in` (defined in index.css)
- Context menu items can be async — `onClick` handler supports `async () => {}` pattern
- To add routing rules from code: `getSettings()` → check existing → `updateSettings({ routingRules: [...existing, newRule] })`
- App.tsx message listener is mount-once (`[]` deps) — use `useRef` + `useEffect` to access changing state (e.g., `activeWorkspaceIdRef`)
- `pendingWorkspaceSuggestion` storage key holds AI/fallback workspace suggestion for sidepanel (US-009)
- `WorkspaceSuggestion` type in types.ts has `tabIds` array for knowing which tabs to move into new workspace
- `checkForWorkspaceSuggestion()` in service worker has 10-min cooldown — safe to call from hot paths
- Workspace suggestion card in App.tsx uses `pendingWorkspaceSuggestion` storage key; dismissal tracked via `suggestionDismissedAt` (24h cooldown)
- `assignTabToWorkspace(tabId, wsId)` from workspaceStorage.ts moves a tab to a workspace in the tab-workspace map
- Service worker maintains `tabInfoCache` (Map<number, {url, title, favIconUrl}>) for recently closed tab tracking — populated on init and updated on create/update events
- `recentlyClosed` storage key holds `RecentlyClosedTab[]` (max 20, FIFO) — each entry has url, title, favicon, workspaceId, closedAt
- `trackRecentlyClosed(tabId)` must be called BEFORE `removeTabFromMap` in onRemoved to capture the workspace ID
- `RecentlyClosedSection` component reads from `recentlyClosed` storage key, listens for storage changes, and is placed between Archive and Quick Notes in App.tsx
- `normalizeUrl(url)` in service worker strips trailing `/`, `www.` prefix, and hash fragment for dedup comparison
- `duplicate-tab-detected` message includes `newTabId`, `existingTabId`, `existingWorkspaceName` — consumed by sidepanel (US-013)
- Notification bars in App.tsx follow a pattern: state + auto-dismiss useEffect + inline JSX below search bar (see autoRouteIndicator and dupNotification)
- `dupNotification` state handles duplicate tab detection UI — auto-dismisses after 8s, only one shown at a time (new replaces old)

## 2026-02-20 - US-001
- Replaced Anthropic and OpenAI API backends with single OpenRouter.ai backend
- Single function `callOpenRouterAPI` replaces `callAnthropicAPI` and `callOpenAIAPI`
- Endpoint: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions`, model: `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001`
- Headers: Authorization Bearer, Content-Type application/json, HTTP-Referer chrome-extension://arcflow
- 10-second timeout via AbortController preserved
- Fallback to heuristic grouping on failure preserved
- Removed provider check — no longer needed since there's a single backend
- Files changed: `src/shared/aiGroupingService.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The `settings.aiGrouping` parameter still has `provider` field — US-002 will clean this up
  - OpenRouter uses OpenAI-compatible response format, so `data.choices[0].message.content` works
  - The `enabled` check in `getAIGroupingSuggestions` still guards against calls when AI is disabled

US-001 is complete. There are still 29 stories with `passes: false`, so more iterations are needed.

**US-001 Summary:**
- Replaced `callAnthropicAPI` and `callOpenAIAPI` with a single `callOpenRouterAPI` function
- Endpoint: `https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions` with model `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001`
- Headers: `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, `Content-Type: application/json`, `HTTP-Referer: chrome-extension://arcflow`
- 10-second timeout via AbortController preserved
- Fallback to heuristic grouping on failure preserved
- Error logged to console with descriptive message
- Typecheck passes, lint passes
- Committed: `ef7376d`
---

## 2026-02-20 - US-002
- Replaced nested `aiGrouping` settings with flat `openRouterApiKey: string` field
- Removed provider dropdown (anthropic/openai) from SettingsPanel
- Added single "OpenRouter API Key" password input field
- Added "Test Connection" button that calls OpenRouter with minimal prompt and shows green checkmark/red X
- Updated `Settings` type in `shared/types.ts`
- Updated `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` in `constants.ts`, removed `AI_PROVIDER_OPTIONS`
- Added migration in `settingsStorage.ts` that converts old `aiGrouping.apiKey` → `openRouterApiKey`
- Updated `aiGroupingService.ts` to accept `openRouterApiKey: string` directly
- Updated `OrganizeTabsModal.tsx` to pass `settings.openRouterApiKey` instead of `settings.aiGrouping`
- Files changed: `src/shared/types.ts`, `src/shared/constants.ts`, `src/shared/settingsStorage.ts`, `src/shared/aiGroupingService.ts`, `src/sidepanel/SettingsPanel.tsx`, `src/sidepanel/OrganizeTabsModal.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Settings migration runs on every `getSettings()` call — lightweight but handles legacy data transparently
  - `TestConnectionButton` is a self-contained component within SettingsPanel (not exported)
  - AI grouping is now implicitly enabled whenever `openRouterApiKey` is non-empty (no separate toggle)

**US-002 is complete.** Committed as `70d7f87`. There are still 28 stories with `passes: false`, so more iterations are needed.

**US-002 Summary:**
- Replaced nested `aiGrouping` settings object with flat `openRouterApiKey: string` field
- Removed provider dropdown (Anthropic/OpenAI) from SettingsPanel
- Added single "OpenRouter API Key" password input field
- Added "Test Connection" button that calls OpenRouter with a minimal prompt (`Say hi`, max_tokens: 5) and shows green checkmark on success, red X with error on failure
- Updated `Settings` type, `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`, removed `AI_PROVIDER_OPTIONS`
- Added migration in `settingsStorage.ts` that converts old `aiGrouping.apiKey` → `openRouterApiKey`
- Updated `aiGroupingService.ts` and `OrganizeTabsModal.tsx` callers
- Typecheck passes
---

## 2026-02-20 - US-003
- Created `src/shared/routingEngine.ts` with `matchRoute(url, rules)` function
- Added `RoutingRule` type to `src/shared/types.ts` with `{pattern, workspaceId, enabled}` fields
- Updated `Settings.routingRules` to use `RoutingRule[]` (added `enabled` field)
- Glob-to-regex conversion: `**` matches everything, `*` matches anything except `/`
- Pattern matched against URL without protocol, and also full URL for `*://` patterns
- Updated service worker `getWorkspaceForUrl` to skip disabled rules
- Updated SettingsPanel "Add Rule" to include `enabled: true`
- Added migration in `settingsStorage.ts` to backfill `enabled: true` on old rules
- Files changed: `src/shared/routingEngine.ts` (new), `src/shared/types.ts`, `src/shared/settingsStorage.ts`, `src/sidepanel/SettingsPanel.tsx`, `src/background/service-worker.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Service worker has its own `globToRegex` that could be replaced with `matchRoute` from routingEngine — future stories (US-004) should consider this
  - The `matchRoute` function strips protocol before matching, so patterns like `github.com/*` work against `https://github.com/repo`
  - Patterns with `*://` prefix are matched against the full URL

**US-003 is complete.** Committed as `af1f3cd`. There are still 27 stories with `passes: false`, so more iterations are needed.

**US-003 Summary:**
- Created `src/shared/routingEngine.ts` with `matchRoute(url, rules)` — glob pattern matching engine for URL-to-workspace routing
- Added `RoutingRule` type to `types.ts` with `{pattern, workspaceId, enabled}` fields
- Glob conversion: `**` matches everything (including `/`), `*` matches anything except `/`
- Pattern matched against URL with protocol stripped, plus full URL for `*://` patterns
- First matching enabled rule wins; disabled rules skipped; returns `null` if no match
- Updated service worker, SettingsPanel, and settingsStorage migration for the new `enabled` field
- Typecheck passes, lint passes
---

## 2026-02-20 - US-004
- Wired auto-routing into service worker `chrome.tabs.onUpdated` listener
- Replaced local `globToRegex` with shared `matchRoute` from `routingEngine.ts` in `getWorkspaceForUrl`
- Added `isIgnoredUrl()` helper to filter chrome://, extension://, about:blank, and newtab URLs
- `onUpdated` now triggers on `status === 'complete'` (not just URL change), calls `matchRoute`, checks if tab is already in target workspace
- Sends `tab-auto-routed` message to sidepanel with tabId and workspaceId when a tab is auto-routed
- Added `tab-auto-routed` message type to `ServiceWorkerMessage` union in types.ts
- Files changed: `src/background/service-worker.ts`, `src/shared/types.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `isIgnoredUrl()` can be reused for future tab event handlers that need to skip internal URLs
  - The `tab-auto-routed` message is consumed by sidepanel — US-007 will add the UI indicator
  - `getWorkspaceForUrl` now delegates to `matchRoute`, eliminating the duplicate glob logic

**US-004 is complete.** Committed as `cebb2b1`. There are still 26 stories with `passes: false`, so more iterations are needed.

**US-004 Summary:**
- Wired auto-routing into service worker `chrome.tabs.onUpdated` listener
- Replaced local `globToRegex` with shared `matchRoute` from `routingEngine.ts` — eliminating duplicate glob logic
- Added `isIgnoredUrl()` helper to filter `chrome://`, `extension://`, `about:blank`, and newtab URLs
- `onUpdated` now triggers on `status === 'complete'`, calls `matchRoute`, checks if tab is already in target workspace before moving
- Sends `tab-auto-routed` message to sidepanel with `tabId` and `workspaceId`
- Added `tab-auto-routed` message type to `ServiceWorkerMessage` union in `types.ts`
- Files changed: `src/background/service-worker.ts`, `src/shared/types.ts`
- Typecheck passes, lint passes
---

## 2026-02-20 - US-005
- Replaced old "Air Traffic Control" inline-edit section with new "Auto-routing" section using dedicated components
- Created `SortableRoutingRuleRow` component — each rule row shows drag handle, pattern text, workspace emoji+name badge, enable/disable toggle, and delete (X) button
- Created `RoutingRulesSection` component — self-contained section with DndContext for drag-and-drop reordering of rules
- "Add Rule" button opens inline form with pattern input (placeholder: `e.g., github.com/*`) and workspace dropdown, with Save/Cancel buttons
- Rules reorderable via @dnd-kit drag handles using `SortableContext` + `verticalListSortingStrategy`
- Toggle switch enables/disables individual rules (updates `enabled` field)
- Rules saved to `settings.routingRules` on add/toggle/delete/reorder
- Files changed: `src/sidepanel/SettingsPanel.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - SettingsPanel now has its own DndContext inside `RoutingRulesSection` — this is separate from App.tsx's DndContext and works independently
  - The `SortableRoutingRuleRow` pattern (sortable row with inline controls) can be reused for other sortable settings lists
  - `RoutingRule` type imported from `shared/types.ts` — already has `enabled` field from US-003

**US-005 is complete.** Committed as `2d902f6`. There are still 25 stories with `passes: false`, so more iterations are needed.

**US-005 Summary:**
- Replaced the old "Air Traffic Control" inline-edit section with a new "Auto-routing" section
- Created `SortableRoutingRuleRow` component: each rule row shows drag handle, pattern text, workspace emoji+name, enable/disable toggle, and delete button
- Created `RoutingRulesSection` component: self-contained section with its own DndContext for drag-and-drop reordering
- "Add Rule" opens inline form with pattern input (`e.g., github.com/*` placeholder) and workspace dropdown
- Rules reorderable via @dnd-kit drag handles
- Toggle switches enable/disable individual rules
- All CRUD operations (add/toggle/delete/reorder) save to `settings.routingRules`
- Typecheck passes, lint passes
- File changed: `src/sidepanel/SettingsPanel.tsx`
---

## 2026-02-20 - US-006
- Added "Always open [domain] here" context menu item for tabs in App.tsx
- Extracts domain from tab URL via `new URL(tab.url).hostname`
- Creates routing rule with pattern `*://domain/*` for the active workspace
- Checks for existing rule with same pattern before adding (shows "Rule already exists" toast)
- Shows success toast: "Tabs from [domain] will auto-route to [emoji] [name]"
- Added toast notification system to App.tsx: `toast` state with 3-second auto-dismiss
- Toast renders as fixed bottom-center overlay with fade-in animation
- Skips chrome:// and extension:// domains (no menu item shown)
- Files changed: `src/sidepanel/App.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - App.tsx now has a reusable toast system — `setToast("message")` for any ephemeral notification
  - Context menu `onClick` handlers can be async — useful for storage operations
  - `getSettings()` must be called at click time (not menu render time) to get fresh routing rules
  - `animate-fade-in` CSS class is already defined in `index.css` — reuse it for entry animations

**US-006 Summary:**
- Added "Always open [domain] here" context menu item to tab right-click menu in `App.tsx`
- Extracts domain from tab URL, creates `*://domain/*` routing rule for the active workspace
- Checks for existing rule before adding — shows "Rule already exists for [domain]" toast if duplicate
- Shows success toast: "Tabs from [domain] will auto-route to [emoji] [name]"
- Added reusable toast notification system to App.tsx (3-second auto-dismiss, fixed bottom-center)
- Skips chrome:// and extension:// domains
- Typecheck passes, lint passes
- File changed: `src/sidepanel/App.tsx`
---

## 2026-02-20 - US-007
- Added auto-routing indicator banner in App.tsx below the search bar
- Listens for `tab-auto-routed` message from service worker via existing `handleMessage` listener
- Uses `activeWorkspaceIdRef` (ref updated via useEffect) to check workspace match inside the mount-once listener
- Banner shows workspace emoji + name: "Tab auto-routed to [emoji] [name]"
- Banner auto-fades after 3 seconds via useEffect timer
- Banner has small X button to dismiss immediately
- Only shows if user is currently viewing the target workspace
- Styled with accent color bg tint, rounded corners, and `animate-fade-in` animation
- Files changed: `src/sidepanel/App.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The message listener in App.tsx is set up once with `[]` dependency — use refs to access changing state inside it
  - `getWorkspaces()` can be called inside the message handler to get fresh workspace data (name, emoji)
  - `animate-fade-in` class from `index.css` works well for entry animations on banners

**US-007 Summary:**
- Added auto-routing indicator banner in `App.tsx`, rendered below the search bar
- Listens for `tab-auto-routed` message from service worker in the existing message handler
- Uses `activeWorkspaceIdRef` (ref synced via `useEffect`) to correctly check the active workspace inside the mount-once listener
- Banner shows: "Tab auto-routed to [emoji] [name]"
- Auto-fades after 3 seconds via `useEffect` timer
- Small X button for immediate dismissal
- Only shows when user is currently viewing the target workspace
- Styled with accent color background tint, `animate-fade-in` animation
- Typecheck passes, lint passes
- File changed: `src/sidepanel/App.tsx`
---

## 2026-02-20 - US-008
- Added AI auto-workspace suggestion engine to service worker
- `getUnorganizedTabs()`: finds tabs not matching routing rules and not in any folder
- `getAISuggestion()`: calls OpenRouter API with unorganized tab titles/URLs, asks for JSON `{suggest, name, emoji, reason}`
- `domainClusterFallback()`: fallback when AI unavailable — groups 3+ tabs from same domain into suggestion
- `checkForWorkspaceSuggestion()`: orchestrates detection, enforces 10-minute cooldown
- Suggestion stored in `chrome.storage.local` under `pendingWorkspaceSuggestion` key
- Sends `workspace-suggestion-ready` message to sidepanel when suggestion is ready
- Added `WorkspaceSuggestion` type to `shared/types.ts` with `suggest, name, emoji, reason, tabIds, createdAt`
- Added `workspace-suggestion-ready` to `ServiceWorkerMessage` union type
- Triggered on tab navigation complete (inside onUpdated handler) and via periodic alarm (every 5 min)
- Files changed: `src/background/service-worker.ts`, `src/shared/types.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `checkForWorkspaceSuggestion` has built-in cooldown (10 min) so it's safe to call from hot paths like onUpdated
  - `pendingWorkspaceSuggestion` storage key holds the suggestion for the sidepanel (US-009) to consume
  - `WorkspaceSuggestion.tabIds` tracks which tabs to move when the user accepts the suggestion
  - Domain clustering fallback capitalizes the first part of the hostname as workspace name (e.g., "github.com" → "Github")

**US-008 is complete.** Committed as `1e4d045`. There are still 22 stories with `passes: false`, so more iterations are needed.

**US-008 Summary:**
- Added AI auto-workspace suggestion engine to the service worker
- `getUnorganizedTabs()`: finds tabs not matching any routing rule and not in any folder
- `getAISuggestion()`: calls OpenRouter API with tab titles/URLs, asks for `{suggest, name, emoji, reason}` JSON response
- `domainClusterFallback()`: when AI is unavailable, groups 3+ tabs from the same domain into a suggestion
- `checkForWorkspaceSuggestion()`: orchestrates the detection with a 10-minute cooldown
- Suggestion stored in `chrome.storage.local` under `pendingWorkspaceSuggestion`
- Sends `workspace-suggestion-ready` message to sidepanel
- Added `WorkspaceSuggestion` type and `workspace-suggestion-ready` message type to `types.ts`
- Triggered on tab navigation complete and via periodic 5-minute alarm
- Typecheck passes, lint passes
- Files changed: `src/background/service-worker.ts`, `src/shared/types.ts`
---

## 2026-02-20 - US-009
- Added AI auto-workspace suggestion card to sidebar in App.tsx
- Listens for `workspace-suggestion-ready` message and loads `pendingWorkspaceSuggestion` from storage
- Also loads pending suggestion on mount (in case message was sent before sidepanel opened)
- Card appears below search bar (after auto-routing indicator) with emoji, name, and reason text
- "Create" button: creates workspace with suggested name/emoji, moves relevant tabs (via tabIds), switches user to new workspace
- "Dismiss" button: hides card, stores `suggestionDismissedAt` timestamp, suppresses re-showing for 24 hours
- Card styled with rounded corners, subtle shadow, accent border matching theme
- Uses existing toast system for success/error feedback
- Files changed: `src/sidepanel/App.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `assignTabToWorkspace` from workspaceStorage.ts is the correct way to move tabs to a workspace
  - `createWorkspace` sets a default emoji, so call `updateWorkspace` right after to set the suggested emoji
  - `loadWorkspaceSuggestion` is a stable callback (via useCallback) so it can be used in the mount-once useEffect dependency array
  - 24h dismissal uses `suggestionDismissedAt` key in chrome.storage.local

**US-009 is complete.** Committed as `cf09dff`. There are still 21 stories with `passes: false` (US-010 through US-030), so more iterations are needed.

**US-009 Summary:**
- Added AI auto-workspace suggestion card to the sidebar in `App.tsx`
- Listens for `workspace-suggestion-ready` message from service worker and loads `pendingWorkspaceSuggestion` from storage
- Also loads pending suggestion on mount (in case message arrived before sidepanel opened)
- Card appears below search bar with emoji, suggested name, and AI-generated reason
- "Create" button: creates workspace with suggested name/emoji, moves relevant tabs into it, switches user to the new workspace
- "Dismiss" button: hides card, stores dismissal timestamp, suppresses re-showing for 24 hours
- Card styled with rounded corners, subtle shadow, accent border, matching the onboarding card aesthetic
- Uses existing toast system for success/error feedback
- Typecheck passes, lint passes
- File changed: `src/sidepanel/App.tsx`

## 2026-02-20 - US-010
- Added recently closed tabs tracking to the service worker
- Added `RecentlyClosedTab` type to `shared/types.ts` with url, title, favicon, workspaceId, closedAt fields
- Added in-memory `tabInfoCache` (Map) to cache tab info since `chrome.tabs.get()` doesn't work after removal
- Cache populated on `initialize()`, updated on `onCreated` and `onUpdated` events, cleaned up on `onRemoved`
- `trackRecentlyClosed(tabId)`: captures tab info from cache, checks for ignored URLs, checks for auto-archived tabs (same URL archived within 2 seconds), stores in `recentlyClosed` storage key
- `recentlyClosed` array capped at 20 entries (FIFO), newest first
- `trackRecentlyClosed` called BEFORE `removeTabFromMap` in `onRemoved` to capture workspace ID
- Files changed: `src/background/service-worker.ts`, `src/shared/types.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `chrome.tabs.get(tabId)` fails after tab removal — must cache tab info proactively
  - `tabInfoCache` is in-memory only, so it's lost on service worker restart; `initialize()` repopulates it from current tabs
  - Auto-archive detection uses a 2-second window: if the same URL was archived within 2s, the closure was likely from auto-archive
  - `trackRecentlyClosed` must run before `removeTabFromMap` to read the workspace mapping while it still exists

**US-010 is complete.** Committed as `25ab3c0`. There are still 20 stories with `passes: false` (US-011 through US-030), so more iterations are needed.

**US-010 Summary:**
- Added `RecentlyClosedTab` type to `shared/types.ts` with `url`, `title`, `favicon`, `workspaceId`, `closedAt` fields
- Added in-memory `tabInfoCache` (Map) in the service worker to cache tab info since `chrome.tabs.get()` doesn't work after removal
- Cache populated on `initialize()`, updated on `onCreated` and `onUpdated`, cleaned up on `onRemoved`
- `trackRecentlyClosed(tabId)`: captures tab info from cache, skips ignored URLs (chrome://, extension://), skips auto-archived tabs (same URL archived within 2 seconds), stores in `recentlyClosed` storage key
- Array capped at 20 entries (FIFO), newest first
- Called before `removeTabFromMap` in `onRemoved` to capture workspace ID while it still exists
- Typecheck passes, lint passes
- Files changed: `src/background/service-worker.ts`, `src/shared/types.ts`
---

## 2026-02-20 - US-011
- Created `RecentlyClosedSection.tsx` component following collapsible section pattern (like ArchiveSection)
- Section placed between Archive and Quick Notes in App.tsx
- Section header: 'Recently closed' with count badge and collapse toggle
- Each entry shows: favicon (16px), title (truncated 40 chars), workspace emoji, relative time
- Clicking entry: opens URL in new tab, assigns to original workspaceId via MOVE_TAB_TO_WORKSPACE message, removes from list
- 'Clear all' button empties the list with no confirmation
- Section hidden entirely when recentlyClosed array is empty
- Reads from `recentlyClosed` storage key, listens for chrome.storage.onChanged for live updates
- Files changed: `src/sidepanel/RecentlyClosedSection.tsx` (new), `src/sidepanel/App.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `RecentlyClosedSection` receives `workspaces` prop to resolve workspace emoji from workspaceId
  - The component uses the same `formatTimeSince` helper pattern as ArchiveSection (local function)
  - `chrome.tabs.query({ url })` can find recently opened tabs to assign workspace after reopening
  - Entries are keyed by `${url}-${closedAt}` to ensure uniqueness

**US-011 is complete.** Committed as `d5ccc20`.

**Summary:**
- Created `src/sidepanel/RecentlyClosedSection.tsx` — new collapsible section component following the ArchiveSection pattern
- Section header: "Recently closed (N)" with count badge and collapse toggle
- Each entry shows: favicon (16px), title (truncated 40 chars), workspace emoji badge, relative time ("2m ago")
- Clicking an entry reopens the URL in a new tab, assigns it to the original workspace, and removes it from the list
- "Clear all" button empties the list (no confirmation per spec)
- Section hidden entirely when the `recentlyClosed` array is empty
- Listens for `chrome.storage.onChanged` for live updates
- Placed between Archive and Quick Notes in `App.tsx`
- Typecheck passes, lint passes

There are still 19 stories with `passes: false` (US-012 through US-030), so more iterations are needed.

## 2026-02-20 - US-012
- Added `normalizeUrl()` function to service worker: strips trailing `/`, removes `www.` prefix, removes hash fragment
- Added duplicate tab detection in `onUpdated` handler (status === 'complete'): normalizes new tab URL, compares against all other open tabs
- If duplicate found, sends `duplicate-tab-detected` message to sidepanel with newTabId, existingTabId, existingWorkspaceId, existingWorkspaceName
- Self-comparison excluded (skips same tabId), chrome://, extension://, about:blank URLs ignored
- Added `duplicate-tab-detected` to `ServiceWorkerMessage` union type in types.ts
- Only reports first duplicate found (breaks after first match)
- Files changed: `src/background/service-worker.ts`, `src/shared/types.ts`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - `normalizeUrl` uses `new URL()` for robust parsing — handles edge cases like ports, query strings
  - Duplicate detection runs after auto-routing in the same async block, so routing happens first
  - `existingWorkspaceName` is pre-formatted as "emoji name" for direct display in sidepanel UI

**US-012 is complete.** Committed as `e271012`.

**Summary:**
- Added `normalizeUrl()` function to service worker: strips trailing `/`, removes `www.` prefix, removes hash fragment for consistent URL comparison
- Added duplicate tab detection in the `onUpdated` handler (status === 'complete'): normalizes the new tab's URL and compares against all other open tabs in the current window
- If a duplicate is found, sends `duplicate-tab-detected` message to sidepanel with `newTabId`, `existingTabId`, `existingWorkspaceId`, and `existingWorkspaceName`
- Self-comparison excluded, chrome://, extension://, about:blank URLs ignored
- Added `duplicate-tab-detected` to `ServiceWorkerMessage` union type in `types.ts`
- Typecheck passes, lint passes

There are still 18 stories with `passes: false` (US-013 through US-030), so more iterations are needed.

## 2026-02-20 - US-013
- Added tab deduplication notification bar in sidebar (App.tsx)
- Listens for `duplicate-tab-detected` message in the existing handleMessage listener
- Shows yellow-tinted notification bar below search bar: "Already open in [Workspace emoji+name]"
- "Switch" button: closes duplicate tab, activates existing tab, switches workspace if needed
- "Keep Both" button: dismisses notification, keeps both tabs open
- Bar auto-dismisses after 8 seconds with fade-out transition
- Only one dedup notification shown at a time (new message replaces old via setState)
- Files changed: `src/sidepanel/App.tsx`
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Notification bars follow a consistent pattern in App.tsx: state variable + auto-dismiss useEffect + inline JSX
  - `handleDupSwitch` uses `activeWorkspaceIdRef.current` (not state) for workspace comparison since it may run inside stale closures
  - `CLOSE_TAB` and `SWITCH_TAB` messages are fire-and-forget — no need to await
