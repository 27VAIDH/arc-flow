## Codebase Patterns
- Storage: Chrome Storage API (chrome.storage.local) for most data; IndexedDB for large/frequent data (navigation events)
- Service worker opens/closes DB per write (no persistent connection — worker may suspend)
- Alarms registered in chrome.runtime.onInstalled, handled in chrome.alarms.onAlarm listener
- All alarm handlers use .catch(() => {}) for silent failure with retry on next alarm
- Message types defined as discriminated unions in types.ts (ServiceWorkerMessage, SidePanelMessage)
- crypto.randomUUID() available in service worker for generating IDs
- chrome.webNavigation.onCommitted fires before page title is available; title fetched via chrome.tabs.get()
- chrome.storage.local.get() returns Record<string, any> — cast results explicitly to avoid TS errors
- Tab switch tracking uses undirected pairs (A→B and B→A count together) for affinity
- Autopilot scoring: score = matchedConditions × rule.priority; all conditions must match for a rule to score
- Settings toggle pattern: use `handleUpdate({ field: !settings.field })` with toggle button styling from existing sections
- TIME_MACHINE_RETENTION_OPTIONS constant in constants.ts for dropdown (7/14/30 days)
- pruneOldEvents() in navigationDb.ts accepts optional maxAgeDays parameter (defaults to 30)
- Tree building: chain events via referrerTabId; best parent = most recent event on referrer tab before child's timestamp
- getNavEventsSince() returns all events from a timestamp; filter client-side for end bound
- Graph building: nodes keyed by URL, edges keyed by type:source|target; tabId→URL map built from sorted navEvents for resolving references

## 2026-02-24 - INFRA-01
- Implemented IndexedDB-backed navigation event tracking system
- Files created: src/shared/navigationDb.ts
- Files modified: src/shared/types.ts, src/background/service-worker.ts, public/manifest.json
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - IndexedDB must be opened/closed per operation since service workers can suspend
  - chrome.webNavigation.onCommitted fires for subframes too — filter by frameId === 0
  - Page title not available at onCommitted time; need chrome.tabs.get() which may fail if tab closed
  - Skip chrome://, chrome-extension://, and about: URLs from tracking
  - Session ID is regenerated on service worker restart (using crypto.randomUUID())

INFRA-01 is complete. There are still stories with `passes: false` remaining (INFRA-02 is next at priority 2).

**INFRA-01 Summary:**
- Added `NavigationEvent` interface to `types.ts`
- Created `src/shared/navigationDb.ts` with IndexedDB wrapper (`initNavigationDb`, `addNavEvent`, `getNavEvents`, `getNavEventsSince`, `pruneOldEvents`)
- Added `chrome.webNavigation.onCommitted` listener in service-worker.ts to record navigation events
- DB opened/closed per write (service worker safe)
- Events pruned after 30 days via daily alarm
- Added `webNavigation` permission to manifest.json
- Typecheck and tests pass
---

## 2026-02-24 - INFRA-02
- Implemented tab switch affinity tracking via chrome.storage.local
- Files created: src/shared/affinityStorage.ts
- Files modified: src/shared/types.ts, src/background/service-worker.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - chrome.storage.local.get() returns `Record<string, any>` — need explicit cast for typed arrays
  - Linter auto-converts `let` to `const` if no reassignment detected in same scope — use `let` only when reassignment is nearby
  - previousActiveTabId tracked as module-level variable in service worker for tab switch pairs
  - Affinity pairs use undirected keys (min:max) so A→B and B→A count together
  - Storage log capped at 10,000 entries to prevent unbounded growth

**INFRA-02 is complete.** There are still stories with `passes: false` remaining (US-T1-01 is next at priority 3).

**INFRA-02 Summary:**
- Added `TabSwitchEntry` interface to `types.ts` with `from`, `to`, `timestamp` fields
- Created `src/shared/affinityStorage.ts` with `recordSwitch()`, `getAffinityPairs(minCount)`, `pruneOldSwitches(maxAgeDays)`
- Storage key is `tabSwitchLog` in `chrome.storage.local`
- Added tab switch recording in `chrome.tabs.onActivated` listener in service-worker.ts using `previousActiveTabId` tracking
- Switch log capped at 10,000 entries
- Typecheck and tests pass
---

## 2026-02-24 - US-T1-01
- Implemented Time Machine settings: enable/disable tracking, retention period (7/14/30 days)
- Files modified: src/shared/types.ts, src/shared/constants.ts, src/sidepanel/SettingsPanel.tsx, src/background/service-worker.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Settings interface in types.ts must match DEFAULT_SETTINGS in constants.ts exactly
  - SettingsPanel uses `handleUpdate()` for partial settings updates — same pattern for all new settings
  - Toggle button styling: `bg-arc-accent` when enabled, `bg-gray-300 dark:bg-arc-surface-hover` when disabled
  - Prune alarm handler reads settings to get retention days, then passes to pruneOldEvents()
  - `getSettings()` is already imported in service-worker.ts — no additional import needed

**US-T1-01 is complete.** There are still stories with `passes: false` remaining (US-T1-02 is next at priority 4).

**US-T1-01 Summary:**
- Extended `Settings` interface with `timeMachineEnabled: boolean` and `timeMachineRetentionDays: number`
- Added `DEFAULT_SETTINGS` values: `timeMachineEnabled: true`, `timeMachineRetentionDays: 30`
- Added `TIME_MACHINE_RETENTION_OPTIONS` constant (7/14/30 days)
- Added Time Machine section to `SettingsPanel.tsx` with toggle and retention dropdown
- Service worker now checks `timeMachineEnabled` before recording navigation events
- Prune alarm handler reads `timeMachineRetentionDays` from settings
- Typecheck and tests pass
---

## 2026-02-24 - US-T1-02
- Implemented Navigation Tree Builder for Time Machine feature
- Files created: src/shared/timeMachineStorage.ts
- Files modified: src/shared/types.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Tree building chains events via referrerTabId; best parent is the most recent event on the referrer tab before the child's timestamp
  - getNavEventsSince() in navigationDb.ts returns all events from a timestamp onward; filter client-side for end bound
  - NavTreeNode is a recursive type — children sorted oldest-first for natural reading, roots sorted newest-first
  - Orphan events (no referrer or no matching parent) become root nodes
  - eventsByTabId map is key for efficient parent lookup during tree construction

**US-T1-02 is complete.** There are still stories with `passes: false` remaining (US-A-01 is next at priority 5).

**US-T1-02 Summary:**
- Added `NavTreeNode` interface to `types.ts`: `{ event: NavigationEvent, children: NavTreeNode[] }`
- Created `src/shared/timeMachineStorage.ts` with:
  - `buildNavigationTree(events)` — chains events via `referrerTabId`, orphans become roots, sorted newest-first
  - `getTreesForTimeRange(start, end)` — fetches from IndexedDB and builds trees for a time window
- Typecheck and tests pass
---

## 2026-02-24 - US-A-01
- Implemented Annotation data model and chrome.storage.local-backed storage layer
- Files created: src/shared/annotationStorage.ts
- Files modified: src/shared/types.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Annotation storage uses chrome.storage.local (not IndexedDB) — annotations are small, don't need indexing
  - Storage key is `annotations` — same pattern as other chrome.storage.local stores (tabSwitchLog, etc.)
  - saveAnnotation() does upsert — checks by id, updates if exists, appends if new
  - exportAnnotations() supports both JSON and Markdown formats; Markdown groups by page URL
  - Annotation interface has XPath + textOffset + textLength for precise text location, plus fallbackScrollY for when XPath fails

**US-A-01 is complete.** There are still stories with `passes: false` remaining (US-AP-01 is next at priority 6).

**US-A-01 Summary:**
- Added `Annotation` interface to `types.ts` with all required fields: id, url, pageTitle, type ('highlight' | 'note'), text, comment, color, xpath, textOffset, textLength, fallbackScrollY, createdAt
- Created `src/shared/annotationStorage.ts` with:
  - `saveAnnotation(a)` — upsert by id
  - `getAnnotationsForUrl(url)` — filter by URL
  - `deleteAnnotation(id)` — remove by id
  - `getAllAnnotations()` — return all
  - `exportAnnotations(format)` — JSON or Markdown export
- Storage key is `annotations` in `chrome.storage.local`
- Typecheck and tests pass
---

## 2026-02-24 - US-AP-01
- Implemented Autopilot Rules Data Model — interfaces and settings defaults
- Files modified: src/shared/types.ts, src/shared/constants.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - AutopilotCondition uses a discriminated `type` field ('time' | 'domain' | 'displayCount') with a string `value` for flexibility
  - AutopilotRule has `priority` field for scoring engine to weight matched rules
  - Autopilot disabled by default (`autopilotEnabled: false`) but notifications enabled (`autopilotNotify: true`)
  - Settings interface and DEFAULT_SETTINGS must stay in sync — add to both simultaneously

## 2026-02-24 - US-AP-02
- Implemented Autopilot Scoring Engine — pure-function evaluation of autopilot rules
- Files created: src/shared/autopilotEngine.ts
- Files modified: src/shared/types.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - AutopilotContext interface has currentTime (Date), activeTabUrl (string), displayCount (number)
  - Time conditions use 'HH:MM-HH:MM' format and support cross-midnight ranges (e.g., '22:00-06:00')
  - Domain conditions support wildcard patterns ('*.example.com') and exact match
  - DisplayCount condition compares integer equality
  - All conditions must match for a rule to be scored (AND logic)
  - Score = matched condition count × rule priority; highest score wins
  - getBestMatch() returns null when no rules match (no enabled rules, no conditions, or no full match)

**US-AP-02 is complete.** There are still stories with `passes: false` remaining (US-G-01 is next at priority 8).

**US-AP-02 Summary:**
- Added `AutopilotContext` interface (`currentTime`, `activeTabUrl`, `displayCount`) and `ScoredRule` interface to `types.ts`
- Created `src/shared/autopilotEngine.ts` with:
  - `scoreRules(rules, context)` — evaluates all enabled rules, returns scored results sorted by score descending
  - `getBestMatch(rules, context)` — returns highest-scoring rule or null
- Time conditions support `HH:MM-HH:MM` format including cross-midnight ranges
- Domain conditions support wildcard patterns (`*.example.com`) and exact match
- DisplayCount conditions check integer equality
- All conditions must match (AND logic); score = matched count × rule priority
- Typecheck and tests pass

## 2026-02-24 - US-G-01
- Implemented Graph Data Builder — builds graph nodes + edges from navigation events and tab switch affinity
- Files created: src/shared/tabGraphStorage.ts
- Files modified: src/shared/types.ts
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - GraphNode uses URL as its ID (unique key for deduplication)
  - Nodes built from navEvents (visitCount) + openTabs (isOpen flag); open tabs always included even without nav events
  - Navigation edges built by tracking tabId→URL mapping over sorted events, then linking via referrerTabId
  - Switch edges built by resolving affinity pair tabIds to URLs using tabId→URL map or open tab URLs
  - Edges keyed by type:source|target to aggregate weights across multiple events
  - Nodes capped at 50 by highest visitCount
  - getDomain() uses URL constructor with try/catch for robustness
