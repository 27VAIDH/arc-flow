# Ralph Progress Log
Feature: ArcFlow v1.1 — Delight & Stickiness (Swipe, Panel Color, DnD, Rename)
Branch: ralph/v1.1-delight-stickiness
---

## Codebase Patterns
- Accent color applied via CSS variables (--color-arc-accent) set in useTheme.ts applyAccentColor()
- COLOR_PALETTE array (12 colors) shared between SettingsPanel.tsx and WorkspaceSwitcher.tsx
- lightenColor() in useTheme.ts lightens a hex color by 20% for hover variants
- Workspace data stored via chrome.storage.local with schema versioning in workspaceStorage.ts
- Inline rename pattern: editing state + editName + inputRef + committedRef guard (see FolderHeader in FolderTree.tsx)
- DnD uses @dnd-kit/core + @dnd-kit/sortable with custom collision detection in App.tsx
- DnD ID prefixes: tab:, folder-item:, folder:, folder-drop: — pinned apps use raw UUIDs
- Tab list uses react-window (FixedSizeList) for >50 tabs with TAB_ITEM_HEIGHT = 36px
- Storage changes propagated via chrome.storage.onChanged listeners
- All workspace data (pinnedApps, folders, notes) lives inside the Workspace object in workspaceStorage.ts
- Inline rename inputs MUST call e.stopPropagation() in onKeyDown to prevent parent DnD/keyboard handlers from intercepting Enter/Escape
- When adding inline edit to a clickable item, guard the onClick handler with `if (!editing)` to prevent navigation during edit
- Per-workspace auxiliary data (e.g., tabNameOverrides) stored as separate chrome.storage.local keys with `_<workspaceId>` suffix
- VirtualTabRow passes props via rowProps — any new DraggableTabItem props must also be added to VirtualTabRowProps and VirtualTabRow
---

## 2026-02-17 - US-001
- Fixed folder double-click rename Enter key bug
- Added e.stopPropagation() to FolderHeader rename input's onKeyDown handler
- Files changed: src/sidepanel/FolderTree.tsx (line 123)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The SortableFolder component (parent of FolderHeader) has an onKeyDown handler on its wrapper div that intercepts Enter to toggle collapse — any inline input inside it MUST stopPropagation
  - Same pattern will apply to US-002 (folder item rename) — the DraggableFolderItem also has an onKeyDown handler that intercepts Enter
  - The committedRef guard + editing state + inputRef + editName pattern is the standard inline rename pattern in this codebase

## Iteration 1 - Tue Feb 17 18:07:26 IST 2026
Tool: claude

US-001 is complete. There are still 14 stories with `passes: false` remaining (US-002 through US-015).

**Summary of US-001 completion:**
- **Bug**: The Enter key in the folder rename input was being intercepted by the parent `SortableFolder`'s `onKeyDown` handler (which toggles folder collapse on Enter), preventing `commitRename()` from firing.
- **Fix**: Added `e.stopPropagation()` as the first line of the rename input's `onKeyDown` handler in `FolderHeader` (FolderTree.tsx:123).
- **Commit**: `c3baee4` — `feat: US-001 - Fix folder double-click rename Enter key bug`
- **Typecheck & lint**: Pass cleanly.

## 2026-02-17 - US-002
- Added inline double-click rename to folder items in FolderTree.tsx
- Added editing/editName/inputRef/committedRef state to DraggableFolderItem component
- Double-click on item title enters edit mode; Enter/blur saves; Escape cancels
- onKeyDown calls e.stopPropagation() to prevent parent DnD handlers from intercepting
- e.preventDefault() + e.stopPropagation() on double-click prevents navigation
- Empty names rejected and revert to original
- Optimistic UI update via setFolders in App.tsx, then persists via renameItemInFolder()
- Files changed: src/sidepanel/FolderTree.tsx, src/sidepanel/App.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The onItemRename prop flows: App.tsx -> FolderTree -> SortableFolder -> DraggableFolderItem
  - When adding inline edit to a clickable item, guard the onClick with `if (!editing)` to prevent clicks during edit
  - The pre-existing eslint error in App.tsx (set-state-in-effect at line 530) is not from our changes

## Iteration 2 - Tue Feb 17 18:11:17 IST 2026

US-002 is complete. There are still 13 stories with `passes: false` remaining (US-003 through US-015).

**Summary of US-002 completion:**
- **Feature**: Added inline double-click rename to folder items in `DraggableFolderItem` component
- **Pattern**: Reused the same `editing`/`editName`/`inputRef`/`committedRef` pattern from `FolderHeader`
- **Key details**:
  - `e.stopPropagation()` in `onKeyDown` prevents parent DnD handlers from intercepting Enter/Escape
  - `e.preventDefault()` + `e.stopPropagation()` on double-click prevents navigation
  - onClick guarded with `if (!editing)` to prevent clicks during edit mode
  - Optimistic UI update in App.tsx via `setFolders`, then persisted via `renameItemInFolder()`
- **Files changed**: `src/sidepanel/FolderTree.tsx`, `src/sidepanel/App.tsx`
- **Commit**: `38fdfa9` — `feat: US-002 - Add double-click rename to folder items in FolderTree`
- **Typecheck**: Passes cleanly
---

## 2026-02-17 - US-003
- Added double-click rename to pinned apps in PinnedAppsRow.tsx
- Reused existing editingApp state and handleEditSubmit/handleEditKeyDown from right-click rename
- Added onDoubleClick prop to SortablePinnedApp component
- handleDoubleClick calls e.preventDefault() + e.stopPropagation() to prevent app URL opening
- Added e.stopPropagation() to handleEditKeyDown to prevent parent handler interception
- Files changed: src/sidepanel/PinnedAppsRow.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - PinnedAppsRow already had full inline edit infrastructure (editingApp state, editInputRef, handleEditSubmit, handleEditKeyDown) — only needed to wire up onDoubleClick
  - The edit input renders above the icon grid (not inline in the icon) — this is a different pattern from FolderTree inline rename
  - Pre-existing eslint warning about editingApp deps in useEffect (line 150) is not from our changes

## Iteration 3 - Tue Feb 17 18:13:13 IST 2026

US-003 is complete. There are still 12 stories with `passes: false` remaining (US-004 through US-015).

**Summary of US-003 completion:**
- **Feature**: Added double-click rename to pinned app icons in `PinnedAppsRow.tsx`
- **Approach**: Reused the existing `editingApp` state, `handleEditSubmit`, and `handleEditKeyDown` that were already wired for right-click rename
- **Key changes**:
  - Added `onDoubleClick` prop to `SortablePinnedApp` component
  - `handleDoubleClick` calls `e.preventDefault()` + `e.stopPropagation()` to prevent the app URL from opening
  - Added `e.stopPropagation()` to `handleEditKeyDown` to prevent parent handlers from intercepting Enter/Escape
- **Files changed**: `src/sidepanel/PinnedAppsRow.tsx`
- **Commit**: `be585de` — `feat: US-003 - Add double-click rename to pinned apps`
- **Typecheck & lint**: Pass cleanly

## 2026-02-17 - US-004
- Added double-click rename to open tabs in the sidebar via DraggableTabItem
- Added tabNameOverrides state (Record<number, string>) to App.tsx, stored per-workspace in chrome.storage.local as `tabNameOverrides_<workspaceId>`
- DraggableTabItem now accepts displayName and onTabRename props
- Double-click enters inline edit mode; Enter/blur saves; Escape cancels
- onKeyDown calls e.stopPropagation() to prevent parent handler interception
- e.preventDefault() + e.stopPropagation() on double-click prevents tab switching
- onClick guarded with `if (editing) return` to prevent clicks during edit mode
- committedRef guard prevents double-commit on simultaneous blur + Enter
- Tabs with custom names display in italic with original title in tooltip
- Empty name input clears the override and reverts to original title
- Also updated VirtualTabRow to pass through displayName and onTabRename for virtual list rendering
- Files changed: src/sidepanel/App.tsx
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - tabNameOverrides stored as separate chrome.storage.local key per workspace (`tabNameOverrides_<wsId>`) rather than inside the Workspace object — keeps workspace storage lean
  - VirtualTabRow component passes props via rowProps — any new DraggableTabItem props must also be added to VirtualTabRowProps interface and the VirtualTabRow function signature
  - The RefObject type import from React is needed when using `useRef<HTMLInputElement>(null) as RefObject<HTMLInputElement>` pattern
